# Question

What are the two arguments that `useEffect` accepts? 

# Answer
`useEffect` accepts a callback function and a array but the array is optional.
A callback function and a dependency array.
The Dependency array is a optional array that decides weather or not the callback function repeats. If the array passes with no change then the callback will stop running.
