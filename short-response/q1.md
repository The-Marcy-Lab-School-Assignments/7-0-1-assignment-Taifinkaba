# Question

What are the two arguments that `useEffect` accepts? 

# Answer
`useEffect` accepts a callback function and a array but the array is optional.
A callback function and a dependency array.
The Dependency array is a optional array that decides weather or not the callback function repeats. If the array passes with no change then the callback will stop running.

Awesome answer! However, the wording on the last sentence is a bit confusing. Can you clear it up? What exactly do u mean by "If the array passes with no change"?
