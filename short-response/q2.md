# Question

Consider the React component below. Explain the three ways that we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run. For each, provide an example of the dependency array to help explain your answer.

```js
const MyComponent = ({ someProp }) => {
  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }, '???');

  return (
    <div>
      <!-- Some More JSX -->
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Answer
The  3 ways we can provide a array to trigger  the `useEffect` would be: no array  so it would run `console.log`, a empty array, and a array with variables inside of it.

While your examples are correct, explain the behavior of each, as well as leave code examples of how they're used.
